Performance of various classification models in Sentiment Analysis (NLP)
Firstly, we perform text cleaning which includes removing spaces and then transforming all letters to lower case, followed by removing all words that are not relevent in our prediction i.e., stopwords.
Then, we apply various classification models on our cleaned text and evaluate performance based on accuracy score.
